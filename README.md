Sudoku solver

A Sudoku puzzle is a grid-based numerical challenge that involves filling a 9x9 grid with digits from 1 to 9. 
The objective is to ensure that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains every digit exactly once, while starting with a partially filled grid.

I have thus developed a code that implements a recursive backtracking algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles of various difficulty levels.
In backtracking algorithms, the approach involves constructing a solution incrementally. If it becomes evident at a certain point 
that the current path cannot lead to a solution, you backtrack to the previous step and explore an alternative route
Implemented with recursive sudoku backtracking algorithm, The Sudoku Solver solves sudoku of all levels.
